# Back-end - NoSQL in the cloud // Module 5 - Project 1

## Project brief 

Create a MERN stack w and play around with routes, JSON data and the code. 

## The Goal 
<ul>
<li>Understand how to make a RESTful API</li>
<li>Understand what a NoSQL database is</li>
<li>Understand the difference between a NoSQL and SQL database</li>
<li>Understand how to query a NoSQL database</li>
<li>Be able to create a web server that gets data from a database</li>
<li>Be able to respond to a get request and serve some data from the server</li>
</ul>


## Intro
Going into the back-end portion of our study was terrifying since I don't feel like I have the front-end part of it down. But the step-by-step tutorial from Smári was great and really easy to understand. I feel like I learned a lot in this guide and I can't wait to dive deeper into the back-end even though my interest lie in the front part of the coding. 

## The Process

I started going through the guide that Smári made (https://faun.pub/the-mern-stack-for-beginners-e607eb8b7100), installed <strong>Yarn</strong> and <strong>Express</strong> and setup my first ever server. Then I created a <strong>MongoDB</strong> account and made my first Database. I created a simple <strong>React</strong> app too see if everything was working as it should. Once everything was working I played a little bit with the Database which I created and added more data into it and made a simple filtering app. 


## The journey

Since the tutorial from Smári was really simple everything fell nicely into place. I was terrified to start the project but once I got started it was actually really enjoyable and it was nice seeing everything coming together. I had a lot of fun putting together the React part of the assignment even though the subject was quite boring there was a lot of work that went into it. 


## Conclusion 

I will for sure be using the MERN stack again, I am really happy that we got the chance to do some back-end work even though I was pooping my pants about starting this Module. I quite enjoyed it and it was really satisfying seeing your data come up on the screen when everything was ready.
